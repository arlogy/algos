Here you'll find interesting algorithms that I have implemented in C++. Source
code can be easily compiled using `CMake`, otherwise you might need to update
project-specific `#include` statements to be relative to the project tree
structure.

This repository is structured as follows.

- `deps`: dependencies or routines for use in projects in the repository.
- `rsrc`: shared resource directory for projects in the repository.
- `src`: source code per algorithm project.
- *The above structure applies more specifically to each project in `src`.*
