- `word_dict`: a dictionary of words with optimized lookup operations supporting
substitution, insertion and deletion of characters to get a word in the
dictionary. Basically, exact and soft word matchings are allowed. Use cases
include *autosuggestion of words* from a dictionary or repository based on
similarity (edit distance) to user input, *spell checking* and *autocompletion*.
